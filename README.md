# Behaviour Analysis for Ciona larave swimming

This repository contains files associated with the paper in revision  titled **"Comprehensive analysis of locomotion dynamics in the protochordate Ciona intestinalis reveals how neuromodulators flexibly shape its behavioral repertoire"**. 

The codebase contains python scripts and jupyter notebooks that were used to analyze the data generated by the behavioural assays performed in the [Chatzigeorgiou lab](www.chatzigeorgioulab.com), and using the tracking software Tierpsy Tracker developed by Andre Brown's lab, MRC LMS [Github link](https://github.com/Tierpsy/tierpsy-tracker).   

The data used in the analysis is available at hosted on Zenodo [link here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6761772).
